### Video Games
I play video games extensively. ***Dota 2*** ([my dotabuff page](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/194883564)) is my most played game, which I've spent more than 3000 hours on. My highest MMR was around 5k, but I haven't played ranked games since a long time ago.

I have played ***World of Warcraft*** (as a rogue only!) for more than 10 years, and most of my time was spent in CN region. I started playing in US region since Tier 19, and raided semi-hardcorely with a top-30 US guild to clear Tomb of Sargeras ([my warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/26180110?zone=13&mode=detailed#difficulty=4&partition=1)). I'm currently AFK, since I find it hard to spend 10 hours raiding every week, and WoW is not that attractive as it was before.

Besides Dota and Wow, I also love playing adventure/role playing/strategy games. This includes ***The Elder Scrolls*** series, ***Divinity: Original Sin*** series, ***Civilization*** series, ***Stellaris***, ***Total War*** series, and so on. Check [my steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ryutaa/) to find more!

### Arcade Games and Music

I'm a fanatical arcade rhythm game fan, with ***Dance Dance Revolution*** and ***Jubeat*** being my most played games.

I also play (casually) other rhythm games like ***Beatmania IIDX***, ***SOUND VOLTEX*** and ***CHUNITHM***, and I love trying out new ones. SEGA's ***ONGEKI*** is my current new favorite.

Because of my interests towards rhythm games, I developed a deep fond of speedcore/dubstep/future bass music. My favorite artists include ***[t+pazolite](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y345wfGiorcB2NXcsJxOt)***, **[かめりあ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4bwIf0yXJf0F9AmOl2J78M)**, and ***[Laur](https://soundcloud.com/laur_10)***.

### Anime
I'm a huge Japanese anime and manga fan. Check [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/bunbohuehue#statistics) to see if you share a similar taste with me!
